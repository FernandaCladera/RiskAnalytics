# RiskAnalytics

Welcome to the Risk Analytics 2024 project! This repository is all about exploring how we can use data and advanced statistical methods to tackle real-world challenges in finance, weather, and air pollution.

### Practical 1:
Financial analytics, focusing on the behavior of cryptocurrency returns, stationarity, normality assumptions, and volatility modeling using ARIMA and GARCH approaches. Dependencies between Bitcoin and Ethereum are also analyzed.

### Practical 2: 
Extreme weather analysis in Lausanne, using block maxima and Peaks-Over-Threshold methods to estimate precipitation return levels and probabilities, addressing seasonal and clustered extreme events.

### Practical 3: 
Air pollution in New Delhi, analyzing PM2.5 concentrations with seasonal variations and factors like vehicle emissions and wind patterns. Statistical models like GEV and GPD are employed for return level analysis.

This repository provides datasets, analysis scripts, and detailed documentation to replicate and extend the study.
