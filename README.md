# RiskAnalytics

This repository contains the project “Risk Analytics 2024,” developed for the HEC-501 course at University of Lausanne. The project explores statistical and modeling techniques applied to financial markets, extreme weather, and environmental pollution. It is structured into three practicals, each addressing a unique risk domain:

### Practical 1:
Financial analytics, focusing on the behavior of cryptocurrency returns, stationarity, normality assumptions, and volatility modeling using ARIMA and GARCH approaches. Dependencies between Bitcoin and Ethereum are also analyzed.

### Practical 2: 
Extreme weather analysis in Lausanne, using block maxima and Peaks-Over-Threshold methods to estimate precipitation return levels and probabilities, addressing seasonal and clustered extreme events.

### Practical 3: 
Air pollution in New Delhi, analyzing PM2.5 concentrations with seasonal variations and factors like vehicle emissions and wind patterns. Statistical models like GEV and GPD are employed for return level analysis.

This repository provides datasets, analysis scripts, and detailed documentation to replicate and extend the study.
